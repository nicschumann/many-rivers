# Many Rivers Simulation

See notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PQ0wF_xWlWM-RUFgz8H5vhUfOcaQMElsj9E-nqdxzM/edit).
See parameters and data overview [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iB5RIkZLDeMv-5rSvzoV2wJ_OsHZMr0B6UDHJGvZYRQ/edit#).

## Installation

To get this up and running, first clone the repository into your local computer. Go to the project directory in your terminal, and do:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all of the dependencies you need for this project. Once, this is done, do:

```sh
npm run serve
```

This will to start a development server, and then visit `localhost:8080` in a browser.

There're two other scripts as well:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will compile the assets without a starting a development server. There's also:

```sh
npm run deploy-gh-pages
```

This will compile and push the public folder to a gh-pages branch, in case you quickly want to get a test-site up and running. I'd typically add an additional deploy script for a custom environment later.
