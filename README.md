# Many Rivers

This is a single repository intended to unify and organize our computational work on the 2023 *Many Rivers*. Inside you'll find directories for each of the key pillars of the project: `simulation`, `rendering`, and `installation`. A goal of this repository is to make data and assets related to this installation as discoverable and reusable as possible. Fingers crossed for future deplyments ðŸ™ƒ.

## Simulation

The simulation directory contains code for a web-based simulation playground, which Lukas and Nic are using to prototype and refine the overarching river simulation.


## Rendering

*As yet unpopulated. Once it exists, this directory will contain resources, assets, and code related to rendering the simulation for projection into the gallery space.*

## Installation

*As yet unpopulated. Once it exists, this directory will contain code for any hardware components integrated into the physical space*
